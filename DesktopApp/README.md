# Theia Desktop Application

This repository contains the companion desktop application for the Theia cameras. It communicates with the cameras via a Serial connection using a one-byte command set. It provides functionality to control the cameras, download and display data from them and analyze the radiometric data. <br>

The application is developed using python (PySide6). A Windows image is provided in a zip file. The application can be run directly from the unzipped directory by double clicking the application executable.
